# What's Lacking Today

## **Organizational Structures today**

We do live in societies, and organizations already exist.  
Organization are typically hierarchical: 

- Government (city council, mayor, state senator, congressman, ... POTUS).   
- The Church (priest, cardinal, ... pope)  
- The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes (Fred, Barney, ... Grand Poobah)

Sometimes the organization's control is nakedly profit driven:

- Twitter Blue  
- Tinder Platinum  
- Teachers union

Some organizations might be dysfunctional, corrupt as directed by their financial backing, or just gone rogue, hijacked by their current leadership:

- RNC  
- DNC  
- NWA  
- NAACP

Regardless of the malady, today's organizations always have a center, which is necessarily powerful, and we've learned well that, "absolute power corrupts absolutely".  
It has become impossible for us as individuals to trust that we're in control more so than corruption, radicals, or special interests.  
The technology does exist today for us to organize ourselves independent of any official or singular center.

I read this about the [Houthi mess in Yemen in the Wall Street Journal today (1/13/24)](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-strikes-give-yemens-houthis-the-enemy-they-long-sought-50415f4c) ([archived here](https://archive.is/jbVfm)):  
“War has become a way of life,” she said. “Governance for the people to create prosperity is an alien concept.”  
Are we Americans any different today? True that, our Protestants and Catholics get along just fine, but we have Republicans and Democrats. Are Republicans really trying to improve the border situation, would they agree to improving it under Democrat rule, or is our country like Yemen, where "War has become a way of life", and "Governance for the people to create prosperity is an alien concept"?  
Time for us to organize ourselves on our own terms, right?

## **Reputation today**

These services and others try to address reputation, but only from the limited experience on their respective platforms.

- Ebay (for buyers and sellers)  
- Airbnb (for hosts and renters)  
- Uber (for drivers and passengers)

But what about actual people, not just "users"? These services make no effort to consider a person's lifetime of accumulated reputation.  
Wouldn't you rather buy something online from someone your own trust network says is trustworthy rather than from an Ebay user with a high star rating based only on their selling history as that user on that site?

### The Myth of the Homogeneous Personality and Trust Contexts

I might trust a man to fix my car but not to date my daughter.  
I might consider you to be "reliable" but not "interesting", or maybe "interesting" but not "reliable".  
One-of-us.net will be built with this in mind and will use trust contexts to support this reality.

## **Information today**

Consider today's mess

- spam  
- fake news  
- media corruption  
- censorship and cancel culture  
- viral posts  
- "2 minute" reads  
- memes  
- hot influencers

People today even use these as sources of information

- IG  
- MyFace  
- LinkedIn  
- Fox News  
- Late night comedians  
- NY Times

We're overwhelmed by the noise. Our attention spans have been diminished. Our faith in truth has been shattered.   
Can we possibly still find information that we'd trust, and would we still be capable of considering it with focus and an open mind?  
Can we still learn or change, or does all of the information we're capable of finding (or that is capable of finding us) simply reinforce what we already think we know?  
The scrolling / news-feed platforms have been designed to show us what we want to see, whether we're looking to admire what we already support or to rage against what we already hate.  
Our newspapers are online; when they report what we don't like, it's too easy to switch and find what we do like. They've become more polarized than ever in a cycle with their readership, us.

I have some long standing personal relationships, and we don't agree on everything, which is great.  
When someone I admire intellectually says something unexpected, in particular something with which I differ, I pay attention. That's when I feel susceptible to learning, changing, growing.   
In case they introduce me to someone and tell me that that person is knowledgeable, I might try to remember that, try to leverage that, but I can't possibly; I'll forget, lose track, it gets out of hand too quickly.  
One-of-us.net aims to give all people a voice that those who should trust them, those who would be interested, could find and hear.   
Are there folks out there that consider you knowledgeable? Would you like to have a voice with them? Would you like to be able to say something and have it be backed by your lifetime of reputation?

## **Recommendations today**

These services are completely anonymous and allow any input from the Internet at large

- Yelp  
- Google Maps  
- Rotten Tomatoes  
- forums

They're susceptible to spam, bots, idiots, or worse.  
Wouldn't you rather find a restaurant, book, or movie based on a network of folks you trust for such recommendations?

Other services like Netflix, YouTube, or Amazon, for example, do know what you've watched or bought, what you started watching but ditched halfway through, what you've explicitly disliked, what you chose to follow or bookmark, but like other services mentioned earlier, they have a monopoly on this information and so they make little effort as they feel little pressure from competition (which lacks that information) to improve.  
We've all heard about the "algorithms" these platforms use to get us to engage with their platforms, to find content we might enjoy, to show us ads for products we might buy, to find stories we might read, etc...  
These algorithms are effective because they're backed by lots of data. That data is from us, but it's not ours. It's not possible for anyone other than Netflix to use Netflix's data to make better movie suggestions for you (ditto for TikTok, Amazon, Facebook, IG, etc..).  
Furthermore, these algorithms are opaque to us. We don't know if they're slanted to promote, demote, suppress, or even censor certain content to serve themselves or their backers instead of us. Did my post about "The Great Barrington Declaration" receive zero likes because my friends didn't like it, or because Facebook decided to not even show it to them?  
Were this data all open, it'd be possible for competing services to leverage it and to compete on a variety of fronts, integrity being among them.

# The possibilities

## **Trust strangers**

I've let friends of friends crash at my place. When I have, I've known that in case for any reason I regret having done so, say they soil my crib, I can tell my friends what happened. They may or may not offer to help clean up, but regardless they should be made aware and thus lower the reputation of their friend. This is how societies work.  
Humanity has done this forever, and long before the existence of credit ratings agencies, some folks were known to their communities as having good credit, of having a good reputation. The word of mouth approach could very well work in a small town, but it won't scale to Manhattan, not to mention the world.

Craigslist could be usable again\!

## **I am not a robot**

You reading this now: You're either one of us, or you're one of them.

## **Filter spam, Whitelist instead of Blacklist**

In a nutshell, that's what this entire thing is \- a whitelist. 

Whitelisting means that rather than assuming that information that's just out there somehow is good, we assume that it isn't \- it's an ad or dumb or clickbait or spam unless proven not to be \- unless someone you trust (probably indirectly through a large network) has vouched for it.  
Blacklisting is the opposite approach \- rather than identifying the good, use signals to try and detect the bad. This approach may have worked for a minute in the infancy of the Interweb when there was hardly any information on it at all. Back then good folks put up good information; the spam snuck in later. At first it was easy to identify spam \- sites with "sex" all over the background, emails with the subject "V I A G R A", but the effort to detect the spam is a losing cat-and-mouse-game and always will be.

Emails, texts, no worries.  
To make this seamless, apps could integrate adding the sender's cryptographic signature of the content when sending and filtering for this when receiving. It could then be automatically put in folders and/or generate/silence alerts based on if it's from a human (one-of-us) or not.

I've seen friends ditch one messaging platform for another in a vapid pursuit of evading spam: "My email is too noisy, text me.", "I get too many texts, IG message me.", "My IG can't handle the noise, let's WhatsApp.", etc... Sound familiar?

## **Less Scrolling, More Sharing and Aggregating. No Data Monopolies, No Noise**

Facebook, X, TikTok, and others want page views and ad views.

## **Censor openly and collaboratively**

Censorship is challenging. We don't want to ban books or cancel ideas, but we probably do want to protect our kids or even ourselves from some content. That said, we don't want to give someone or something else the power of controlling what is censored from us.

"I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced... but I know it when I see it ..."

- Justice Potter Stewart explaining "hard-core" pornography, or what is obscene (1964)

Why not use a trust network to know it, tag it, and that way you don't even have to see it?  
This is a trivial case for the decentralized trust network concept. Anyone can tag content as "censored", or "obscene", thereby censoring it from anyone who trusts their judgment regarding censorship or obscenity.  
The rest follows trivially. Different folks will trust different folks to censor for them, or not. When something has been censored that someone thinks shouldn't have been, they can adjust their network (ie. block someone, trust others), thereby also adjusting the network for those that trust them for this use.  
There are details to flesh out (websites, domains, accounts, wildcards and such) of course, and some time will be required for your network and tools to stabilize into exactly the censorship you desire, but the concept is sound \- use your distributed trust network for your censorship needs instead of having some other power center do it to you.

## **Top 40, from your point of view, or even from someone else's**

You could trust folks for net.one-of-us.like.music, and so could they.  
You could "like" songs. Apps could integrate that into their players.  
You're on top of your network, and so you should be able to check out the "top 40" from your point of view.  
But as it's all open, you should also be able to check out the top 40 from someone else's point of view, say Lisa's. And in case you enjoy listening to music using Lisa's network more than you do your own, then you could trust Lisa for net.one-of-us.like.music and stop trusting your lame music connections. Now your top 40 is better, and it's also better for those who trust you for net.one-of-us.like.music.  
In case a song that sucks comes on, you can check who liked it and block them from your network.

## **Start a movement**

Someone creates a challenge to sign a statement in the form:  
	I'll go if at least \<X\> others that I trust as \<Y\> commit to going.  
One user says (signs a statement) :  
I'll go if at least 100 others that I trust as "reliable" commit to going.  
Another might say:  
I'll go if at least 300 others that I trust as "reliable" or "serious" commit to going.  
It should not be difficult to develop an app or website to support this and to let you know when you, yourself, have committed to going (because the conditions you've signed on to have been met; for example, you said that you'd go if 100 others you trust as reliable would, and that's happened).

And it wouldn't even need to be movement related like a march, a protest, or a walkout. It could simply be Giants fans showing up at a Miami sports bar to catch Monday Night Football, Gmen vs Finns.  
Not anytime soon, of course, but we could use this to finally elect a third party candidate.

Now, of course, this is similar to Facebook's "Interested in going". The majority of the world today probably has a Facebook account, and no one uses one-of-us.net, and so why exactly would a developer implement an app like this using one-of-us.net tech instead of as a Facebook app? Because it's [open](#bookmark=id.v4g036lmze0i); if you make your group or develop your app inside Facebook, then you're bound to the limitations of their technology and policies, and you can't be sure that they won't divert your traffic away, shut you down, take it from you, or worse..

## **Discover truth**

* The Rona origin: pangolin or Fauci?  
* Salt, coffee, cholesterol: worries or no worries?  
* Gluten: good or great?  
* JFK assassination: Lee Oswald or Oliver Stone?

Well, it depends on whom you trust. I feel good about whom I trust, and I know some top drawer folks, folks who are much better informed than I am in their respective fields be those construction, skiing, medicine, etc... My belief is that if I trust them in their areas of expertise and they do the same (and make that trust knowledge conveniently available to me, of course) then I'll be able to find information I trust and be less confused.. about what to eat, what to read, what to buy, how to vote, no worries.

## **Businesses become reputable**

"Pasture Raised", "Sustainable", "All Natural".. Would these phrases or logos mean something instead of nothing to you if the companies producing these hired reputable folks who you trust and who signed those statements on the product?  
"Pasture Raised" and "Free Trade" packaging often does contain a logo of some certifying organization; you're invited to Google it, check out their webpage, and wonder.. Is this legit?

## **Comment on any comment on any platform**

Comments are everywhere, and they're disorganized.  
Comments about different things should be in different places, but comments about the same thing should be organized together. Furthermore, they should be organized for you, eliminate your spam, and respect those you respect.  
Consider the comments section of an article about a single, specific event in several of today's online newspapers.  
The one-of-us.net search server intends to allow users the ability to

- state an "equivalence" among URLs  
- comment on any URL

This will surely be clunky at first and also late to arrive, but still. Open, heterogeneous, decentralized, and so why not strive for that, right?

## **The "cool" network, or "nerdy", how about "young", "family", or "college friend"**

One-of-us.net is planned to release with a stack of apps that support flexible trust contexts. Naturally, I don't expect us to immediately start classifying everyone we know. But I do expect trends and for some networks like these to actually catch on.

## **Seamless integration**

It's going to start out messy, but my belief is that if the concept is solid, and if folks get it, then it will become seamless. Today, we can sign in to websites using Facebook or Google; we can pay with our phones; we can keep our phone numbers as we switch carriers.  
Sure, Facebook and Pandora aren't just going to give their likes away for free right away, but having us own our likes should put pressure on them to do so; competitors will leverage networks and likes that are of the people, by the people, for the people, and they'll rise by doing so. And eventually, at some point, a bit down the line, we'll all be able to say that   
	All your likes are belong to us.   
Your trusted friends listening to Spotify will make your Pandora station better.

# Risks

## **TLDR; Too Complicated**

This thing's like 17 pages, right?  
How much did you read?  
Do you get it?  
Are you on board?

It's gonna be great one day. Question is, can we recruit the True Believers to get it going.

## **Openness and Lack of Anonymity**

We can have reputation or anonymity, not both.

I accept that Google knows every single place I drove to using Google Maps navigation, and I realize that this includes where I ate, where I shopped, and whom I visited including friends, lovers, hustlers, and worse. Google knows, but it's not public. Google uses that to target ads at me. It's okay.  
Likewise, I'm aware that Amazon knows what I bought, YouTube what I watched, etc..  
But I'm not by any means ready to publish all of this openly.  
I implicitly trust these services to reasonably try to protect my private data, but I don't trust them to reasonably aggregate my purchases along with other users' to help them display to all users the most popular products.  
And so there are benefits to this data being open, but we're ready for much of it to be just nakedly out in the open.

I have friends who believe that if they read it on Instagram then it's for sure really good information \- undeniable, indisputable, irrefutable, incontestable, unarguable, incontrovertible, even sagacious bordering on holy\! I want to remain friends with those people, but I'm not going to tag them as "serious" in my network. I want my serious search results to ignore their likes, and furthermore, in case you trust me as "serious", I wouldn't want their likes contaminating your serious universe either. Now I could tag them as "peculiar", but I'd probably hold off on that, and this is where the risk related to the open and non-anonymous aspects becomes apparent.

## **Bad People**

Now, while I expect that my associates and I will tag folks as "human", "interesting", "reliable", and so forth, others may choose to tag folks as "Jew" and "Jihadist". Technology cannot be rolled back. The Internet, too, can be used by bad people.

## **Crypto Restrictions, the App store, Big Power**

I don't know much about this, but I feel that I'd be naive to think that we can implement an application that takes all control away from big power and not expect some resistance.
