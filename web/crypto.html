      <h1>Cryptography: Signing, Hashing</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Public key cryptography is solid, mature, and well-documented. (Hash
            codes have been around forever.) This project uses standard
            open-source implementations and formats.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The public key is shared openly, like a username.</p></li>
            <li><p>The private key is kept secret, like a password.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>The key holder can "sign" data using his private key.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The signature can be verified by anyone with the signer’s public
            key, ensuring:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                the data was genuinely signed by the holder of the corresponding
                private key and has not been modified.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>No usernames or passwords are required.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="text-iframe-2col">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Demo: Signature Verification</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Click the right arrow to verify the signature</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Go back, change or remove any part of this (public key, content,
                signature), and verify again; the signature will be detected as
                INVALID.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who said that?</h2>
          <p>
            Unless we know who's key that is, the whole thing is vapid. (A robot
            can sign, but a robot can't get me to vouch for its humanity;)

      <h1>Hash codes, Tokens</h1>
      <p>
        Consider a hash code of data as a keyless signature. A hash is short
        regardless of the amount of data. That's why we use them as tokens of
        keys as well as of statements.
      </p>

      <h1>Our use</h1>
      <h3>--Keys</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Identity Layer: You have a public/private key pair; the public key
            is your identity. You vouch for another's identity (and humanity) by
            signing a statement that includes their identity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Delegate Keys: You create and give other services disposable
            public/private key pairs and use your private identity key to sign
            statements stating that these key pairs represent you on those
            services.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>--Tokens</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A key token is used to form the URL for requesting statements signed
            by that key over our HTTP interface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Statement tokens</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                We chain all statements signed by a key to prevent back-dating
                in case a key is compromised. The "previous" field of a signed
                statement is the token of the previous statement signed by that
                key.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We identify the last valid statement signed by a key that is
                revoked by that statement's token.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
