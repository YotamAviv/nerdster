      <h1>Public Key Cryptography</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keys are created in pairs:
          <ul>
            <li>Public key: shared openly (like a username)</li>
            <li>Private key: kept secret (like a password).</li>
            <li>The key holder can "sign" data using his private key.</li>
            <li>
              The signature can be verified by anyone with the signer’s public
              key, ensuring that the data was genuinely signed by the holder of
              the corresponding private key and has not been modified.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Solid, mature, and well-documented technology. This project uses
          standard open-source implementations and formats.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Demo: Signature Verification</h1>
      <div class="text-iframe-2col">
        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Click the right arrow to verify the signature</li>
            <li>
              Go back, change or remove any part of this (public key, content,
              signature), and verify again; the signature will be detected as
              INVALID.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Okay, but who said that?</h3>
          <p>
            Unless we know whose key that is, the whole thing is vapid. (A robot
            can sign, but a robot can't get me to vouch for its humanity;)
          </p>

      <h1>Hash codes, Tokens</h1>
      <p>
        Consider a hash code of data as a keyless signature. A hash is short
        regardless of the amount of data. That's why we use them as tokens of
        keys as well as of statements.
      </p>

      <h1>Our use</h1>
      <h3>--Keys</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identity Layer: You have a public/private key pair; the public key is
          your identity. You vouch for another's identity (and humanity) by
          signing a statement that includes their identity (their public key).
        </li>
        <li>
          Delegate Keys: You create and give other services disposable
          public/private key pairs and use your own, private identity key to
          sign structured statements stating that these key pairs represent you
          on those services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>--Tokens</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A key token is used to form the URL for requesting statements signed
          by that key over our HTTP interface, specifically:
          <code>https://export.one-of-us.net/?spec=&lt;key token&gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Statement tokens
          <ul>
            <li>
              We chain all statements signed by a key to prevent back-dating in
              case a key is compromised. The "previous" field of a signed
              statement is the token of the previous statement signed by that
              key.
            </li>
            <li>
              We identify the last valid statement signed by a key that is
              revoked by that statement's token.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
