      <h1>Public Key Cryptography, Digital Signatures</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keys are created in pairs:
          <ul>
            <li>Public key: shared openly (like a username)</li>
            <li>Private key: kept secret (like a password).</li>
            <li>The key holder can "sign" data using his private key.</li>
            <li>
              The signature can be verified by anyone with the signer’s public
              key, ensuring that the data was genuinely signed by the holder of
              the corresponding private key and has not been modified.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Solid, mature, and well-documented technology. This project uses
          standard open-source implementations and formats.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Demo: Signature Verification</h1>
      <div class="text-iframe-2col">
        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Click the right arrow to verify the signature</li>
            <li>
              Go back, change or remove any part of this (public key, content,
              signature), and verify again; the signature will be detected as
              INVALID.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Okay, but who said that?</h3>
          <p>
            Unless we know whose key that is, the whole thing is vapid. (A robot
            can sign, but a robot can't get me to vouch for its humanity;)

      <h2>Crypto Keys are Cryptic</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike the usernames and passwords we're used to, public/private
        cryptographic key pairs are long and cryptic and can't practically be
        spoken or memorized. This is why we use QR codes (or occasionally
        copy/paste) to communicate them.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>QR codes allow us to communicate public keys using our phones.</li>
        <li>JSON format is used when computers communicate with each other.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sample public key</h2>

      <div class="qr-json-2col">
        <img src="img/sample.png" alt="sample public key" />

        <pre><code>{
  "crv": "Ed25519",
  "kty": "OKP",
  "x": "rHT5B3q3rBCtNUaSBwT7DxT2Y0Q6fgvmhNKbVhJ_BtQ"
}
        </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h2>Sample public/private key pair</h2>
      <div class="qr-json-2col">
        <p>(We don't scan each other's private keys)</p>

        <pre><code>{
  "crv": "Ed25519",
  "kty": "OKP",
  "x": "rHT5B3q3rBCtNUaSBwT7DxT2Y0Q6fgvmhNKbVhJ_BtQ",
  "d": "_MaCrtWx2jHTOrujWXVeihaBBJHF09QUxzwnk6GGiEQ"
}
        </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h2>They come in Pairs</h2>
      <p>
        Lose your private key and your public key is now abandoned. You'll have
        to get a new key pair, can't just replace the private key. (We address
        this with the "replace" statement.)
      </p>

      <h2>Hash codes, Tokens</h2>
      <p>
        Consider a hash code of data as a keyless signature. A hash is short
        regardless of the amount of data. That's why we use them as tokens for
        keys as well as of statements. <br />We hash keys to locate where their
        statements can be retrieved. <br />We hash statements to identify them
        uniquely when forming a chain of statements to prevent backdating and to
        identify the last valid statement signed by a revoked key.
