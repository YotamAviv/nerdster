      <h1>Vouch, Delegate - The Identity Layer</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Vouch for humans</li>
        <li>Delegate to services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Trust, Delegate, Block, Replace</h2>
      <p>
        There are four statement types involved in establishing and maintaining
        the identity layer. All are signed by one key and state something about
        another. This does 2 things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Distribute knowlege about the other key.</li>
        <li>
          Digitally signed by your private key (can be verified as authentically
          signed by you, can't be forged)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <a id="lisa-trust-mom" href="#">Trust</a>: keys you vouch for as
        representing someone "human, capable, and acting in good faith"
        <br />
        <a id="marge-block-sideshow" href="#">Block</a>: keys you've identified
        that should not be trusted
        <br />
        <a id="homer-replace-key" href="#">Replace</a>: lost or compromised
        identity keys you used to use
        <br />
        <a id="marge-delegate" href="#">Delegate</a>: keys that represent you on
        various services (until you
        <a id="sideshow-revoke-marge-delegate" href="#">revoke</a> them).
      </p>

      <p>
        When you vouch for someone else by scanning their ONE-OF-US.NET's phone
        app (or a QR code they shared with you), the ONE-OF-US.NET phone app
        uses your private key to sign and publish a structured statement that
        references their identity key, names them, and affirms that they're
        "human, capable, and acting in good faith".

            tampered with, but we don't know whose key signed this statement.)
