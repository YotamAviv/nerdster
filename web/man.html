    <h1>one-of-us.net — manual</h1>

    <p>
      The one-of-us.net phone app is meant to be simple. It creates, stores, and
      lets you sign statements with your cryptographic public/private key pairs
      (a single identity key pair; as many delegate keys as you want).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Sign and publish trust/block statements referencing other keys thus
        forming our cryptographically secure, web-of-trust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create disposable, delegate key pairs, associate them with your
        identity, and allow other services (<a href="https://nerdster.org/"
          >the Nerdster</a
        >) to state stuff on your behalf.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The statements are replicated to the cloud and are meant to be portable
      and available to be read and trusted by anyone or any service. For
      example, my identity statements are here:
      <a
        href="https://export.one-of-us.net/?token=2c3142d16cac3c5aeb6d7d40a4ca6beb7bd92431"
        >https://export.one-of-us.net/?token=2c3142d16cac3c5aeb6d7d40a4ca6beb7bd92431</a
      >
    </p>

    <h1>
      Beginner: Join the network (trust folks and have them trust you), Sign in
      to the <a href="https://nerdster.org">Nerdster</a>
    </h1>

    <p>
      Until you trust someone else on the network, your network will be empty
      (and useless). Until someone else on the network trusts you, you'll be
      invisible to the network (and useless).
    </p>

    <h2>Trust someone</h2>

    <p>Options:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Meet them in person:</strong> Click on the QR code icon on the
        bottom right of the main screen of the ONE-OF-US.NET phone app, and use
        your phone's camera to scan the QR code on the main screen of the other
        person's ONE-OF-US.NET phone app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Use email, text, or something else to share public keys:</strong
        >
        Folks can share their public key through the Share menu. Ask your
        comrades and associates to share their public key with you. View the QR
        code they sent you on your big computer and scan it with your
        ONE-OF-US.NET phone app. (Your public key is not a secret, so sharing it
        this way is safe.)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Once the app has initiated the process of signing a trust statement, fill
      in the field "moniker" (typically first name) and optionally "comment",
      click Trust, approve, congratulations!
    </p>

    <h3>-- let your associates trust you</h3>

    <p>Do the reverse of the above.</p>
    <p>
      Until someone on the network trusts you, you'll be invisible to the entire
      network, and so this is important.
    </p>

    <h2>Delegate sign in to the Nerdster</h2>

    <p>Access the Nerdster on a computer web browser:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Find it at
        <a href="https://nerdster.org/">https://nerdster.org/</a> or wherever
        else it may be embedded, such as
        <a href="https://aviv.net">https://aviv.net/</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Click "QR sign-in" to display the Nerdster's sign in parameters.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use your ONE-OF-US phone app:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Click the QR icon on the bottom right of your ONE-OF-US phone's main
        screen.
      </li>
      <li>Your phone may ask you for camera permission, allow it.</li>
      <li>
        Use your phone's camera to scan the Nerdster's sign-in parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        If this is your first time signing in, the app may ask you if you want
        to create a "delegate key" for the Nerdster. Do that, and confirm the
        process. (You don't have to create a delegate key. Without one, you'll
        still be able to use the Nerdster to view content from your point of
        view (PoV), but you won't be able to post anything or interact
        otherwise.)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>You should now be signed in and centered as yourself on the Nerdster.</p>
    <p>
      In case you don't see any content, you probably don't one-of-us trust
      anyone, and so your network is empty.
    </p>

    <h1>Statement types</h1>

    <p>
      Statements are signed by your active ONE-OF-US public/private key pair.
    </p>
    <p>The subject of these statements is always another public key.</p>
    <p>
      The verb tells us what you are stating about that other key: trust, block,
      delegate, or replace. The 'clear' verb is a special verb that erases any
      previous statement you've made about that key.
    </p>

    <h2>Form the network: {trust, block}</h2>

    <p>The trust network is defined by the trust relationships.</p>
    <p>In case of fraud or mistakes, a block may be required.</p>

    <h3>--moniker</h3>
    <p>A moniker, typically a first name, is required in trust statements.</p>

    <h2>Authorize other services: {delegate}</h2>

    <p>
      Your **identity key** pair is your identity, but you can also create
      disposable "delegate" keys to hand over to other services to state stuff
      on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h3>--revokeAt</h3>
    <p>
      In case of lost or compromised keys, or in case a delegate service
      misbehaves, you can revoke the key you gave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is done by issuing an overriding delegate statement, this time with
      revokeAt set to the last valid statement so that whatever statements that
      key signs after it's been revoked are not to be considered as valid.
    </p>

    <h2>Maintain your identity {replace}</h2>

    <p>
      In case you lose your phone, reinstall the app, or have your key
      compromised, you can replace your key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to maintain your identity even though you'll be using a new
      key. The statement you'll state with your new key is something like, "This
      new key of mine replaces my old key as of this particular time".
    </p>
    <p>
      All of those you've trusted or blocked with your old key will be
      understood to be trusted or blocked by your new key, and the same goes for
      delegate keys, folks who've trusted you, and even older keys which you've
      replaced before.
    </p>

    <h3>--revokeAt</h3>
    <p>
      A revoked at last statement token is always required for replace
      statements.
    </p>

    <h1>Mechanics of using the app</h1>

    <p>
      The app lists all statements made by your active and replaced keys in 3
      groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>{trust, block}: the subject of these is someone else's key</li>
      <li>
        {delegate}: the subject of these is a key you've handed over to another
        service.
      </li>
      <li>
        {replace}: the subject of these is an old key of yours which you've lost
        or retired.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Overwrite (re-state) or clear (erase) statements</h2>

    <p>
      One key's disposition towards another is singular, and so if you trust a
      key and then block it, only the most recent statement is your key's
      disposition towards the other. The "clear" verb acts as "erase", and so if
      you trust a key and then clear the key, it's like you never said nothin' at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>And so whatever you do can always be undone.</p>
    <p>
      (If you lose your private key, then it's more complicated, but there's a
      path for that, too.)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can re-state any statement by finding it under the "state" menu,
      clicking its box, and updating its fields ("moniker", "revokedAt", or
      "comment").
    </p>
    <p>This will override whatever you previously stated.</p>
    <p>
      You can also clear any statement (similarly, find the statement and choose
      "clear").
    </p>

    <h1>Novice: Maintain your own keys</h1>

    <p>Phones and keys can get lost or hacked.</p>
    <p>
      When you create replacement keys, you need to take a few steps so that
      your network understands that your new key still represents you.
    </p>

    <h2>your identity keys</h2>

    <p>Don't lose your identity key and don't get hacked.</p>
    <p>
      In case you lose your identity key or get hacked, you can replace your
      identity key.
    </p>
    <p>You do this by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>creating a new identity key and</li>
      <li>
        using your new key to sign and publish a statement that it is a
        replacement of your lost key
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But immediately after you do this, no-one will know that you've replaced
      your key. You'll need to reach out to the folks who trusted your old key
      and ask them to trust your new key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once some of them have done that, the others should see a notification on
      their Nerdster that an attempt has been made to replace a key that they
      trust directly, and so they may possibly reach out to you to confirm that
      before you reach out to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To actually get started on this, use the state / replace menu on your
      identity phone app.
    </p>

    <h2>your delegate keys</h2>

    <p>
      In case you had to replace your identity key, then you should use your
      new key to state that your old delegate keys are associated with your new
      identity key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delegate keys for which you still have the private keys can be used by
      importing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delegate keys which you don't have the private keys for can and should
      still be claimed by your active identity key.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you suspect that a delegate key has been compromised, then you can
      re-delegate it and revoke it as you do.
    </p>

    <h1>Advanced: Maintain your network</h1>

    <h2>Identify and block bots, bad actors, or careless humans</h2>

    <p>This is your network.</p>
    <p>Blocking an identity key is harsh!</p>
    <p>
      You should only block a key in case you have strong reason to believe that
      the key:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>does not represent a real person</li>
      <li>
        or maybe it does represent a person, but that person is not acting in
        good faith (eg. blocks indiscriminately, trusts fake "Elon", etc..)
      </li>
      <li>
        or maybe that person trusts too carelessly or just doesn't get it (eg.
        scans QR keys from Instagram)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Help folks you trust maintain their keys</h2>

    <p>
      If and when one of your trusted associates loses their key, they'll need
      for you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a new key</li>
      <li>
        use their new key to state that their new key replaces their old key
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>trust their new key</li>
      <li>clear your trust in their old key</li>
      <li>and possibly to advise them on how to do all this. Please do.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>/etc</h1>

    <h2>Copy/paste instead of QR</h2>

    <p>
      I use copy/paste instead of QR mostly during development, but there may be
      times when the text version of the key is more useful (maybe hard to point
      the phone camera at the same phone's display, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most UI gestures that scan for a QR code also have a paste icon to
      accomplish the same.
    </p>

    <h1>Pitfalls</h1>

    <h3>--DO NOT: Block people you dislike</h3>
    <p>
      Those are real people, and they belong in the ONE-OF-US network. Instead,
      block them for &lt;Nerdster&gt; follow, censor their content, etc...
    </p>

    <h3>--DO NOT: Trust folks by scanning their QR codes from the Nerdster</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose I receive a text from an unknown number saying, "Hey, Tom. This is
      John. I had to get a new phone plan, please update my number in your
      contacts.", I'd want to speak to him first, right?
    </p>
    <p>If you need this explained further, then sorry, bud, you ain't nerd!</p>
