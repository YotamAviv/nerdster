    <h2>NAME</h2>
    <p>
      nerdster — a content rating and discovery tool built on the ONE-OF-US.NET
      identity layer
    </p>

    <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <p>
      Reference implementation for the decentralized identity paradigm All your
      likes are belong to us (us)..
    </p>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Nerdster</b> is a decentralized web application for discovering,
      rating, and discussing content (movies, books, recipes, etc.). Unlike
      traditional social networks, it does not rely on a central authority to
      curate your feed or manage your identity. Instead, it uses the
      <b>ONE-OF-US.NET</b> identity layer to establish a <b>Web of Trust</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users sign their own content statements using cryptographic keys. Nerdster
      aggregates these statements to build a view of the world that is unique to
      each user's <b>Point of View (PoV)</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>TRANSPARENCY</h2>
    <p>
      Nerdster is designed to be &quot;naked&quot; data-wise. It does not hide
      the underlying mechanics of the decentralized web.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Verifiable Statements</b>: Every action you take (rate, comment,
        follow) signs and publishes a cryptographic statement. These can be
        verified by any service, not just Nerdster.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Exposed Plumbing</b>: You can inspect the raw data at any time. Turn
        on <b>Show Crypto</b> in the settings to see the signed JSON statements
        for every item in your feed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Service Discovery</b>: Clicking on a key in the node details view
        reveals where that user's data is being served on the internet.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IDENTITY & SIGN IN</h2>
    <p>
      Nerdster does not have its own account system. Identity is managed
      exclusively by the <b>ONE-OF-US.NET</b> mobile app.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Identity</dt>
      <dd>
        Access to Nerdster requires an identity (a cryptographic public key).
      </dd>

      <dt>Delegate Keys</dt>
      <dd>
        To sign in, use your phone app to create a <b>Delegate Key</b> for the
        Nerdster's use. You can revoke or disassociate this delegation at any
        time on your own (using your <b>ONE-OF-US.NET</b> mobile app, not the
        Nerdster).
      </dd>

      <dt>Sign In</dt>
      <dd>
        <b>Desktop</b>: Use the <b>ONE-OF-US.NET</b> app on your phone to scan
        the QR code displayed on the Nerdster sign-in screen.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <b>Android</b>: Tap the "Magic Link" button on the sign-in page. This
        uses a custom scheme (<code>keymeid://</code>) to launch the identity
        app and initiate the delegation process.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <b>iPhone</b>: Tap the "Universal Link" button. This uses a recognized
        web link (<code>https://one-of-us.net/...</code>) which iOS redirects to
        the installed ONE-OF-US.NET phone app.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <b>Copy/Paste</b>: Advanced users can copy/paste JSON blobs containing a
        public key for &quot;identity&quot; and a public/private key pair for
        the delegate key as &quot;nerdster.org&quot;.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>POINT OF VIEW (PoV)</h2>
    <p>
      Everything in Nerdster is subjective. There is no <b>global truth</b> or
      <b>global average rating</b>. When you use Nerdster, you are seeing the world
      from a specific <b>Point of View</b> (usually your own).
    </p>
    <p>
      The content you see, the ratings you trust, and the tags you browse are
      all filtered filtered by trust. You only see content from people you
      trust, or people trusted by people you trust (up to a configured
      distance).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change the active <b>PoV</b> and <b>Context</b> using the controls
      in the <b>Network Settings Bar</b>. Switching the PoV or Context affects
      your view <b>immediately</b>, updating the graph, feed, and ratings to
      match the selected perspective and topic.
    </p>

    <h2>FOLLOWING & CONTEXTS</h2>
    <p>
      While the Identity Layer handles <b>who is human</b>, Nerdster handles <b>who is
      interesting</b>. You can follow users for different <b>Contexts</b>.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>&lt;nerdster&gt;</dt>
      <dd>
        The default context is &quot;&lt;nerdster&gt;&quot; which follows
        everyone you have personally vouched for in the Identity Layer. You can
        tune this context explicitly (follow or block people in this context)
        without affecting your real-world identity vouching. This affects the
        view of those who &quot;&lt;nerdster&gt;&quot; follow you.
      </dd>

      <dt>Custom Contexts</dt>
      <dd>
        You can define arbitrary contexts like <code>music</code>,
        <code>news</code>, <code>family</code>, <code>local</code>, etc... A
        user you trust for coding advice might be blocked in your
        <code>politics</code> context. This granular control ensures your feed
        remains relevant.
      </dd>

      <dt>Changing Follows</dt>
      <dd>
        You manage your follows visually using the <b>Graph View</b>. Simply
        <b>click on a node</b> (representing a user identity) to select it. The
        side panel will update to show your current relationship. Click
        <b>Follow</b>, <b>Block</b>, or <b>Clear</b> to update your stance for
        any context.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>CONTENT & VERBS</h2>
    <p>
      Users interact with subjects by publishing statements signed by your
      delegate key.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Like</dt>
      <dd>Thumbs up or down.</dd>

      <dt>Comment</dt>

      <dt>Dismiss</dt>
      <dd>
        A gentle way to hide content you've already seen or aren't interested
        in. Dismissals can be set to <b>Snooze</b>, which hides the item until
        new <b>qualified activity</b> (like a new comment from a friend) wakes it up
        or for <b>Forever</b>. You can choose to ignore dismissals using a
        checkbox on the filter bar.
      </dd>

      <dt>Mobile Swipe Actions</dt>
      <dd>
        On touch devices, you can <b>Swipe the Image Left</b> to dismiss it
        <b>Forever</b> (you can add other ratings before hitting publish).
        <b>Swipe the Image Right</b> to <b>Snooze</b> and <b>Like</b>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Censor</dt>
      <dd>
        A harsh action for offensive or dangerous content. Censoring a subject
        removes it from your view entirely. Crucially, your censorship protects
        those who follow you—if you censor something, it is hidden from your
        followers who trust your judgment. You can choose to ignore censorship
        using a checkbox on the filter bar. Like everything else, censorship is
        decentralized and is respected based on who you follow in the context
        you're using.
      </dd>

      <dt>Relate / Equate</dt>
      <dd>
        Users can link subjects together.
        <b>Relate</b> suggests a connection (e.g., "The Matrix" related to
        "Cyberpunk"). <b>Equate</b> asserts two subjects are the same thing
        (e.g., two URLs for the same article).
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>TAGS</h2>
    <p>
      Tags are extracted from comments (e.g., <code>#scifi</code>). Clicking on
      a tag or selecting it in the tags dropdown in the filter bar should show
      content tagged as such and possibly related content.
    </p>

    <h2>FILTERS</h2>
    <p>The interface provides powerful tools to curate your experience.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Dismissal Filters</dt>
      <dd>
        Controls whose dismissals are respected.
        <ul>
          <li><b>My Disses</b>: Hide things I have dismissed.</li>
          <li>
            <b>PoV's Disses</b>: Hide things the current PoV user has dismissed.
            (Currently not in the UI.)
          </li>
          <li><b>Ignore Disses</b>: Show everything, even if dismissed.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Censorship</dt>
      <dd>
        By default, censored content is hidden. You can toggle "Show Censored"
        to inspect what your network has flagged.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>SINGULAR DISPOSITION</h2>
    <p>
      A user can only have one active disposition toward a subject at a time. If
      you "Like" a movie at 10:00 and "Dismiss" it at 10:05, the system only
      respects the Dismissal. The latest statement hides the previous one. A
      newer comment overwrites the former.
      <br />
      The clear rating action removes your previous disposition, like you never
      said nothin' at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conflicts between users (e.g., Alice says "Related", Bob says "Not
      Related") are resolved based on your computed Trust Graph. If you trust
      Alice more than Bob, you see the relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>COMPUTING YOUR NETWORK, SHOWING CONFLICTS</h2>
    <p>
      Nerdster's computation of your Web of Trust is neither definitive nor
      particularly smart. It avoids complex heuristics or voting systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the core dilemma: If one of your trusted friends vouches for an
      identity key (asserting it represents a capable human, acting in good
      faith), but another friend blocks that same key, no software can
      definitively know the truth. Other tools might leverage counts or
      statistical signals to guess, but Nerdster does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, Nerdster simply <b>notifies the parties involved</b>. If your
      associates are in conflict, they'll need to talk to each other and sort it
      out.
    </p>
