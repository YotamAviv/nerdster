Nerdster and ONE-OF-US.NET are not connected, have no special access.

Any service can fetch signed content/statements by the signing key. (Using key token)

The Nerdster or any other service can read and verify your identity statements, but it can't create them and sign them.
Delegate services don't have your identity private key. For now, that's on your phone.
The Nerdster reads, validates, regards, processes, and even shows all your identity statements: trust, block, delegate, replace

Something about fraud and network algorithms

Heterogeneous: Anyone can make a different, better Nerdster leveraging the existing content but better.. Better conflict detection or identity Network, better UI, richer abilities, and that can fragment even further with competing services playing off each other's improvements. Can't do that with our Facebook, X, Insta content..

Facebook is necessarily the authority on which account Facebook liked. Having our own keys lets us be the authority of who we liked. (Maybe in talk)

Possibility: where do I know you from? Scan phones. Oh yeah, your sister was my son's third grade teacher.. expand awareness of community
