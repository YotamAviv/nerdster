### Implications and Aspirations: Organization, Culture, Behavior

- future
  - Like a Wall Street Journal post, follow the author, and it'll be the same person on Reddit, NYT, etc...
  - Your Pandora likes (or even, say, your Nerdster music context blocks) could make my Spotify better
  - Robots can't make my phone ring
    - Gmail human folder
  - start a movement, vote for a 3'rd party
  - A whitelisted Internet (content signed by humans, no bots, no spam)

## Nerdster

- difference of opinion vs. conflict
- Simpsons Bot Farm
  - differences of opinion, conflicts, lost keys, replaced keys, hijacked keys, bogus identities, multiple moms, oh my..

## TODO

The Nerdster whitelists (no blacklisting / spam detection) - only trusted, authentic content is shown.

### Why?

Because you believe.
Same human identities and reputations across Craigslist, Yelp, Maps, eBay, Airbnb, Marketface, VRBO, NYT, WSJ, Reddit, all 4 twitters, ...
In case you do, grow the network.

#### We build it and let them use it. They want to it as much as we do.
