### Examples




### Quotes

### Crypto / tech
- sign
- be (identity)
- vouch
- delegate

### The Open Web
- heterogeneous (open, ready for evolution)
  - interoperable, non-proprietary (standard cryptographic keys, common JSON formats).
- portable, auditable
  - litter the Interweb with signed content
  - Complete cryptographicly signed chain 
  - Signatures are publicly verifiable independent of who stores or serves the data. (You don’t have to trust one-of-us.net or nerdster.org)
- control, ownership
  - No special access.
    Nerdster.org and ONE-OF-US.NET do not have any.
    The Nerdster doesn't know what was is used to sign in.
    ONE-OF-US.NET doesn't know what reads signed statements it published.
  - no accounts
    You don't have an account with ONE-OF-US.NET or Nerdster.org. If anything, you have an account with those who vouched for you.
- decentralized
  - We build the network (decentralized) and **let** them use it.
  - not ONE-OF-US.NET's, not mine. Yours, ours.

### Decentralized Organization.. Culture, Behavior
- authentic
  - reputation, decency, community. truth
  - "Liberated trust"
    - The Internet liberated lies and pornography. Crypto can liberate trust.
- Identity revisited, (opt-in, privacy)
  - An ability, not a requirement, to voice authentically
    - "First Amendment 2.0"
  - Identity revisited: you, irl
    - I am who your network says I am
- decentralized revisited
  - "Democracy 2.0"
    ? "One man, one vote." => "One person, one like."
- future
  - Like a Wall Street Journal post, follow the author, and it'll be the same person on Reddit, NYT, etc...
  - Your Pandora likes (or even, say, your Nerdster music context blocks) could make my Spotify better
  - Robots can't make my phone ring
    - Gmail human folder
  - start a movement, vote for a 3'rd part
  - 


## TODO

The Nerdster whitelists (no blacklisting / spam detection) - only trusted, authentic content is shown.

### Why?
Because you believe.
Same human identities and reputations across Craigslist, Yelp, Maps, eBay, Airbnb, Marketface, VRBO, NYT, WSJ, Reddit, all 4 twitters, ...
In case you do, grow the network.
#### We build it and let them use it. They want to it as much as we do.
