        <h2>Crypto</h2>
        <p>
          Tech advances have made it possible for us to own and manage our own
          identities without relying on any authority or service. By
          cryptographically vouching for each other, we could know who's who
          on any service.
          <br />
          You could "like, comment, or subscribe" authentically, as yourself,
          without relying on an authority like Facebook, X, or Insta, but as
          yourself, on your own. Public key cryptography makes this possible,
          allows you to hold the key.

  <!-- H2: The Open Web that Evolved -->
  <section class="hero">
    <div class="hero-inner">
      <div class="lead">
        <h2>The Open Web that Evolved</h2>
        <p>
          Consider Netscape 1.0 and the early WWW. It was open, decentralized,
          distributed, and heterogeneous, and it evolved specifically for
          those qualities - open for competition, playing no favorites.
          <br />One company's server serves another's data which can be viewed
          by you using browsers from yet another variety of companies, and
          none of them are locked in. Yeah, okay, what else is new?
        </p>
        <p>
          Having us (people) own our identities and allowing us to use them at
          any service enhances all of those qualities. It diminishes
          silo-owned accounts and their leverage over us and their
          competitors. It increases our freedom and can unleash new
          possibilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Not "Yet another one of these..."</h3>
        <p>
          To be clear: this isn't "yet another.." account type, incompatible
          messenger, or aspiring silo... It's the opposite - it connects the
          incompatible. We don't want to own another one of your accounts, we
          want to give you your identity.

            How could you be convinced that someone is human without knowing
            which human?
            <br />
            One way to accomplish that would be to trust a service; for
            example, you could trust Tinder to protect folks' identities while
            ensuring that they're human (for their own, or even from your
            point of view). But without revealing underlying identities,
            delegate keys, and signatures they couldn't be audited; you'd just
            have to trust them. In case services choose to expose the underlying
            delegate keys and signatures, you or other services could audit
            them and make sure they're not cheating. <br />

            The phone app only signs and publishes individual contributions
            but doesn't compute anything. <br />The Nerdster has a rudimentary
            implementation of computing your or my network and aggregating
            subject ratings from our Points of View to demonstrate a starting
            point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other services are expected and invited to do a better job, to
            compete for our attention and trust, to leverage the existing
            content out there and create more, but better.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              better conflict detection or a more robust identity network

            Any improvements could be fragmented further with competing

            our Facebook, X, or Insta content, which is locked in silos.

            Having our identities available to us (our likes, our follows) can diminish their silo monopoly power,
            increase competition, and lead to better services.

          <p>
            If all of us had the choice to say something as an account or as
            ourselves
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Would you devalue what accounts say?</li>
            <li>Would you pay more attention to what actual people say?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you found that what accounts say is garbage and that what people say is worth paying attention to, might
            that change how and what you say?

          that confounds you when the source is your own, chosen trusted network?

          <h3>Democracy 2.0</h3>
          <p>
            Humanity has typically relied on hierarchies and central
            institutions to organize, with concentrated power, corruption, and
            systemic abuse often following. Tech that gives individuals
            verifiable ownership of their voice can enable decentralized
            organization.

            <li>
              No dictators, but you dictate who grounds you to reality (who
              you trust, or block).
            </li>
            <!-- <li>
                If some idiot calls you idiot, block them, for yourself and for
                the fine folks who follow you. If folks you admire call you
                idiot, well, that might be on you. Shape up.
              </li> -->
            <li>
              No center, no hierarchy. You're the center of your network.
            </li>
            <li>
              Robust and resistant to corruption, shutdowns, and censorship.

          <h3>On Decentralized Props and Denigration</h3>
          <p>
            In case you're disrespected by folks you don't respect, no
            worries; your network probably doesn't respect them either and
            isn't interested in their view. If they're in your networks, block
            'em out, clean it up; you'll be doing yourself and those who
            respect your judgment a service. <br />Now, in case you're
            disrespected by folks you do respect, then that might be on you.
            Shape up.
