          <h2>The Open Web that Evolved</h2>
          <p>
            Consider Netscape 1.0 and the early WWW. It was open, decentralized,
            distributed, and heterogeneous, and it evolved specifically for
            those qualities - open for competition and playing no favorites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having us (people) own our identities and use them at any service
            enhances all of those qualities. It diminishes silo owned accounts
            and their leverage over us and their competitors. It increases our
            freedom and can unleash new possibilities.

              Humanity has typically relied on hierarchies and central
              institutions to organize, with concentrated power, corruption, and
              systemic abuse often following. Tech that gives individuals
              verifiable ownership of their voice can enable decentralized
              organization.

                If some idiot calls idiot, block them, for youreslf and for the

                well, that might be on you. Ship up.

              Ouch! That's in poor taste, and I'll call it out - post censored,
              individual blocked for news context.

              Oh, that dude.. Competent trip leader, loves dogs, known him since
              Idaho, (talks too much), impeccable hygiene.. He'd keep it clean
