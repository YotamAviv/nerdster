      <h2>Identity Layer</h2>
      When you scan phones:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You cryptographically sign a statement referencing the other person's public key using
          your own private key.
        </li>
        <li>
          That signed statement is published to a location where everything your key has signed
          can be found.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="cue">
      <h2>Delegate Layer</h2>
      I wouldn't work out well to give 100's of services your private identity key.
      <br />
      When you create and sign in with a delegate key, you:
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new, disposable public/private key pair</li>
        <li>Sign and publish that this key represents you on that service</li>
        <li>Securely transmit that key pair to the service</li>
