      <ul>
        <li>QR Sign-in (or just identify)</li>
        <li>Copy/paste sign-in (or just identify)</li>
        <li>
          Read (or even replicate) and leverage existing statements (they're
          portable)
        </li>
        <li>
          Use delegates for your own service.<br />
          Opt-in: Sign and/or publish your service's users' signed content,
          which would make it portable as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement alternatives to the ONE-OF-US.NET phone app.<br />People own
          their own keys, not ONE-OF-US.NET, not me. They're welcome to export
          and use them however they like.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>QR Sign-in</h2>
      <div class="text-iframe-2col">
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            There is no special access between one-of-us.net and nerdster.org.
            The ONE-OF-US.NET phone app uses the camera to see and read the
            sign-in parameters in the QR code and then performs an HTTP POST
            over the Internet to the address it was instructed to, optionally
            end-to-end encrypted.
          </p>
        </div>

      <h2>Our signed content is published</h2>
      <p>
        Any service can read, verify, and leverage the statements you and your
        delegates have signed and published.
        <br />For example: My signed content is here:
        <a
          href="https://export.one-of-us.net/?spec=%222c3142d16cac3c5aeb6d7d40a4ca6beb7bd92431%22"
          >identity</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://export.nerdster.org/?spec=%22f4e45451dd663b6c9caf90276e366f57e573841b%22"
          >Nerdster content</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>Leverage these to fit your needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identity statements so your service can compute who's who and who.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nerdster follow statements so your service can compute who's
          intresting to whom and for what.
        </li>
        <li>
          And all the rest of it: ratings, comments, equate/relate statements,
          and so forth.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your service can do whatever</h2>
      <p>
        Your service doesn't need to be as naked and transparent as the
        Nerdster.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It doesn't have to use delegate keys; it might be enough for your
          service to just identify a Point of View (PoV).
        </li>
        <li>
          It doesn't have to expose folks' content, although this enables other
          services to audit (which can add responsibility).
        </li>
      </ul>
