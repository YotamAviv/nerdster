      <h1>Ready Now</h1>
      <p>
        Any service, big or small (consider Craigslist.org, for example) could
        do any of these today:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          have us sign in using the ONE-OF-US.NET phone app as ourselves using
          (or not) their own delegate keys
        </li>
        <li>
          implement its own phone app to replace the ONE-OF-US.NET phone app
          (your keys are yours and available for export)
        </li>
        <li>
          read, verify, and leverage the content you've signed and published
          elsewhere
        </li>
        <li>
          start publishing content signed by our own delegate key for that
          service and make it available (or not) to us all
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This (and only this) is what Nerdster and the ONE-OF-US.NET phone app
        use. The phone app stores your identity private key on your phone, and
        Nerdster can remember your private delegate key, but otherwise, both
        apps read and verify your own signed, published content as they load up,
        just like other services would to leverage that data.
      </p>

      <h2>QR Sign-in</h2>
      <div class="text-iframe-2col">
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            There is no special access between one-of-us.net and nerdster.org.
            The ONE-OF-US.NET phone app reads the
            <strong>Sign-in Parameters</strong> in the QR code, checks if a
            delegate key for (<span class="json-highlight">"domain"</span>) is
            present, and then performs an HTTP POST over the Internet to the
            address (<span class="json-highlight">"url"</span>) it was
            instructed to, optionally end-to-end encrypted using the disposable
            encyption public key provided (<span class="json-highlight"
              >"encryptionPk"</span
            >).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="embed">
          <iframe id="flutterApp"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Our signed content is published</h2>
      <p>
        For example: My signed content is here:
        <a
          href="https://export.one-of-us.net/?spec=%222c3142d16cac3c5aeb6d7d40a4ca6beb7bd92431%22"
          >identity</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://export.nerdster.org/?spec=%22f4e45451dd663b6c9caf90276e366f57e573841b%22"
          >Nerdster content</a
        >.<br />
        Both services publish all signed content at
        <span class="code"
          >https://export.&lt;service&gt;/?spec=&lt;key token&gt;</span
        >.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity statements so any service can compute who's who.</li>
        <li>
          Nerdster follow statements so any service can compute who Nerdster
          follows who and for what (if they care ;), and all the rest of it too:
          ratings, comments, equate/relate statements, censor statements, etc...
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Services are free to choose</h2>
      <p>
        Other services don't need to be as naked and transparent as the
        Nerdster, don't have to use delegate keys (just identifying a Point of
        View (PoV) might be enough), and they don't have to expose folks' signed
        content, although this enables other services to audit, and that can
        enhance credibility, which is nice.
