              Everything you do on the Nerdster leads to publishing a
              statement signed by your delegate key (which is you).
            </p>
            <p>
              Viewing from anyone else's PoV is also fully transparent
              respecting their follows, blocks, likes, and disses... Wouldn't it
              be nice to know what other real people read, like, believe? Might
              that help us all?
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all apps that embrace the ONE-OF-US.NET paradigm are expected
              to do this. For example, Yelp could let people author reviews
              without revealing their identities and still leverage the
              ONE-OF-US.NET network to only show you recommendations made by
              folks that either you or they believe are humans (one-of-us).
              (Even Tinder could do this.)
              <br />
              You'd have to trust them not to cheat, but for services like the
              Nerdster, auditing is supported: the signed content is fully
              portable and can be verified by anyone or anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open data (signed and portable). My own statements, for example:
              <a
                href="https://export.nerdster.org/?spec=f4e45451dd663b6c9caf90276e366f57e573841b"

              <li>
                Experimental <strong>censor</strong> feature - allow your
                network to filter what you see. Like everything else, censorship
                is transparent; turn it off (checkbox); check again; block folks
                who censored inappropriately. View from others' PoV to see what
                they censored, what's censored in their PoV.
                <br />
                Use Lisa's PoV, for example, and check what Marge censored for
                her.
              </li>
              <li>
                Puny and weak, won't handle content from thousands around you
                (but you can shift PoV to see any content).

                Generate a link for your Nerdster using your PoV and settings
