          <p class="muted">
            Not all apps that embrace the ONE-OF-US.NET paradigm are expected to

            <h3>Purist: naked, fully open</h3>
            <p>
              Everything you do on the Nerdster leads to publishing a statement
              signed by your delegate key (which is you).
            </p>
            <p>
              Viewing from anyone else's PoV is also fully transparent
              respecting their follows, blocks, likes, and disses... Wouldn't it
              be nice to know what other real people read, like, believe? Might
              that help us all?
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all apps that embrace the ONE-OF-US.NET paradigm are expected
              to do this. For example, Yelp could let people author reviews
              without revealing their identities and still leverage the
              ONE-OF-US.NET network to only show you recommendations made by
              folks that either you or they believe are humans (one-of-us).
              (Even Tinder could do this.)
              <br />
              You'd have to trust them not to cheat, but for services like the
              Nerdster, auditing is supported: the signed content is fully
              portable and can be verified by anyone or anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open data (signed and portable). My own statements, for example:

                Experimental <strong>censor</strong> feature - allow your
                network to filter what you see. Like everything else, censorship
                is transparent; turn it off (checkbox); check again; block folks
                who censored inappropriately. View from others' PoV to see what
                they censored, what's censored in their PoV.
                <br />
                Use Lisa's PoV, for example, and check what Marge censored for
                her.
              </li>

              follow relationships, and both legitimate and bogus ratings and
              comments.

                (reprehensible, and only trusted when viewing as Milhouse or one
                of the clowns)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>From Lisa's PoV, things look harmless and agreeable:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No notifications</li>
              <li>
                Content: horses (Lisa),
                <a id="marge-banana-rate" href="#">recipes (Marge)</a>, bowling
                (Homer), skateboarding (boys), alt movies (employees)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Try these:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Toggle censorship to see what Marge has censored:
                <a id="censor-on" href="#">on</a>,
                <a id="censor-off" href="#">off</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                Change Settings to show Crypto (JSON, keys, and statements):
                <a id="crypto-on" href="#">on</a>,
                <a id="crypto-off" href="#">off</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                Load my PoV, click on any Simpsons statement, and notice that
                they're all unknown to me (<span class="code"
                  >"I": "&lt;unknown&gt;"</span
                >). And they'll remain that way as they're not human, not in my
                network, and in case you bring them into my network by vouching
                for them, I'll block you. That's how this works.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notice that many statements' authors look different when
                different PoVs are used. For example, as Bart has made sure to
                not have his mom in his network, Marge's statements' author
                ("I") is "&lt;unknown&gt;".
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Change your Point of View (PoV) to Bart's and notice how things
              are messier:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Notifications because Bart hasn't reacted yet to Homer's
                replaced key notification.
              </li>
              <li>
                Milhouse trusts clowns who are bad actors, various block
                conflicts show up.
              </li>
              <li>
                Content is cruder as Bart has specifically blocked Lisa and
                Marge from his default follow context.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Using Milhouse's PoV, things seem downright fraudulent:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                His trust in clowns brings in bogus people that Sideshow Bob is
                trying to use to manipulate clown movie ratings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even his name is shown as "4-Eyes" as Sideshow Bob mocks him.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Use differnt follow contexts.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a id="social" href="#">"social"</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a id="identity" href="#">"&lt;identity&gt; (all humans)"</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a id="nerdster" href="#">"&lt;nerdster&gt; (the default where you follow everyone you've vouched for unless you've overridden)"</a>

            </ul>

            <p>
              Much fraud can be removed by viewing the network more strictly, by
              requiring 2 paths of trust. But with such a small network,
              Milhouse ends up seeing almost nothing. This setting is accessible
              from Settings ⇒ "Identity Network" ⇒
              <a id="standard" href="#">"standard"</a> (the default is
              <a id="permissive" href="#">"permissive"</a>).
