Our own decentralized identity network...
What does that mean..
Why would would want it..
How do we do it.

When you talk to something to someone in person, you sort of know who it is, not to mention that he's not a robot.
But it's not like that online.

Demo

Scan Tom's phone..
That's it by the way.. That's all you have to do to build our decentralized identity network.

Explain:
When you scan phones:

- You reference the other person's public key
- You sign a statement vouching for who he is and that he's not robot using your own private crypto key (that always stays on your phone, unless you export it for use with other software)
- You publish that signed statement in a location where everything your key has signed can be found.

when you create the delegate:

- You create a disposable public/private key pair
- You sign and publish a statement stating that that key represents you on a service
- You securely transmit that key pair to the service.

Complete cryptographic digital signature chain starting at your key to all the whitelisted content you see.

Show Crypto boxes
Show statements and keys on the nerdster.

- see statatement, raw or interpreted, for every activity.
- find any key's statements
- Double click on keys to see token. Key token used to fetch statements it's signed

All activities on the apps signs and publishes a statement

- portable, verifiable by anything as having been done by that key

Both apps get all of their content from those same published statements.

- Nerdster and ONE-OF-US.NET are not connected, have no special access.

Heterogeneous: Anyone can make a different, better Nerdster leveraging the existing content but better.. Better conflict detection or identity Network, better UI, richer abilities, and that can fragment even further with competing services playing off each other's improvements. Can't do that with our Facebook, X, Insta content..

# Your identity is your crypto key. That's the paradigm

- You can use any tech to sign with it, issue delegates, claim and revoke old keys, vouch for others
- Folks can be their own identities on any service, not an account at a particular service
- Folks can follow or otherwise reference identities instead of accounts at a particular service

# Nerdster sample features

Change PoV

- Demo phone not in network
- names change, decentralized
- content changes

Block Tom, follow Andrew

- leverage identity layer
- like all the other actions, this can be verified and leveraged by your network on other services you use. Portable

## What we didn't do

- Pick a username. But we did name Tom
- Pick a password or sign in traditionally

# Close account

- No accounts. The demo phone sort of gave the Nerdster an account, not the other way around. And then it removed that account.
- Demo phone never had an identity acount (and it never will, as neither I nor anyone in my network will vouch for its humanity)
- I don't have an identity account with ONE-OF-US.NET or any other service. If anything, I have an account with the folks who've vouched for me.

# TODO

Mention revoking at or identifying offending statements

Scan a few keys and mention reprehensible

# Rate as quickly as possible (dismiss confirmations quickly)

# Review Crypto boxes

## Now show Nerdster crypto

### Every action creates a statement

- Visible in the app
  - raw or
  - interpreted
- Show:
  - identity key
  - Identity statement
  - delegate key
  - Nerdster statement
- Visible on the Web, signed, portable. Show statements on web
  This the place (_only_ place) where the Nerdster gets data

PoV ...
Follow, block
Rest of boxes

Thanks!
